# McKinsey’s Datathon: The City Cup

Code from the 2019 edition of the McKinsey’s Datathon: The City Cup, where we won in Spain and became 3rd in the global phase (Spain, Germany and Russia).

This was a one-day competition, so we didn't have too much time to try complex models, so we mainly focused on extracting insights from the dataset given.

Code developed together with Andrés Olivares and Amanda Marqués
